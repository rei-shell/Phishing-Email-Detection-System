## Project Title: 
Phishing Email Detection System

## Short description: 
Detect fraudulent email, 

## Problem: 
Email scam is a growing threat in the cyber landscape. The goal is to build a system that automatically analyses emails and flags out potential phishing attempts.

## Proposed Method: 
We will create a rule-based system in Python. It will analyse various features of an email (sender, keywords, links) and assign a risk score based on predefined rules. HTML will also be used to display the system for User Experience.

## Expected Outcome: 
A command-line or simple web-based tool that takes an email (or a directory of emails) as input and outputs a classification (Safe/Phishing) along with a risk score.

## Team Allocation:
- Qi Feng: Suspicious URL Detection, Edit Distance Check
- Jomond: Final Risk Score
- Raphael: Whitelist Check, Keyword Detection
- Rachelle: Keyword Position Scoring
